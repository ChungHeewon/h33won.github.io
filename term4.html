            Pete Pelkey loves eating ice cream. Every time he eats an ice cream cone, he derives a certain amount of pleasure from it. Pete wondered if he could get an infinite amount of pleasure if he ate ice cream continuously. He learned the hard way that this was not the case. The first few ice cream cones that he ate made him squirm with delight, but as he reached his 5th cone, the amount of pleasure that he derived from eating a cone started to decrease. Pete was getting pleasured less and less with each subsequent ice cream cone. Eventually, Pete reached a point where eating ice cream gave him no pleasure at all. If Pete had known about the law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, then Pete couldâ€™ve consumed less ice cream so that he could still derive some pleasure from eating one cone. The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility states that as consumption increases, the marginal utility derived from each additional unit decreases.
