        Pete Pelkey is a world-renowned potato farmer. There are four main factors of production that go into creating the world’s best potatoes. The first factor is land. Pete found the best 200 acres of potato farming land in the middle of Florida. Of course, Pete also needed the help of other people in order to plant all his potatoes. Pete decided to employ 10 laborers to help him harvest his potatoes. In order to efficiently plant and harvest potatoes, capital is needed. Pete intelligently invested in multiple tractors and plows to make his farming experience easier. This entire operation would’ve been impossible without Pete’s own management skills. Somebody had to manage the land, labor, and capital in order to bring about a successful harvest and Pete Pelkey was the entrepreneurial genius that made it all happen. With land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship, Mr. Pelkey and his laborers were able to bring about a successful potato harvest and prospered for years to come.
