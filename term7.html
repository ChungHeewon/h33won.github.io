            Pete Pelkey is an artist. Pete can create 40 paintings or 20 drawings on any given day. However, Pete isnâ€™t restricted to only creating one thing during a day. Pete can create a combination of paintings and drawings if he so desires. For each new drawing that he decides to make, Pete must give up producing two paintings on that day. Meanwhile, for each painting that Pete wants to create, he must give up on producing half of a drawing on that day. You can create a graph in which the amount of paintings that Pelkey produces goes on the Y-axis while the amount of drawings that he produces goes on the X-axis. From there, you can draw a line in order to connect the points that represent each possible combination of drawings and paintings that Pete could produce on that day. A graph like this is known as a Production Possibilities Curve. It shows all possible output possibilities for two goods given a set of inputs consisting of resources and other factors.
