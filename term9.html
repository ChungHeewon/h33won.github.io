            In the country of Pelkland, a wide array of goods and services are created every year. The citizens of Pelkland (Pelksters) consume $1,000 worth of goods every year. The goods that Pelksters consume include things like coffee, hamburgers, and lamps. There is also $500 worth of business investment in Pelkland each year. Investment is when businesses purchase goods that will help them produce their own goods and services more efficiently. The government of Pelkland also does its own spending and spent $250 this year. The goods that businesses in Pelkland create aren’t just sold domestically. People in other countries bought $ 700 worth of goods that were created in Pelkland. The Pelksters also don’t just purchase domestically made products. They bought $500 worth of imported goods this year. If you add the consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports (exports – imports) of Pelkland, you get $1000 + $500 + $250 + ($700 - $500) which equals $1950.
